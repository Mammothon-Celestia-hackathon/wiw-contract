## Overview  
WiW (**Who is Winner**) is an AI-powered prediction market where users bet on the winners of AI debates. Two AI agents engage in discussions on various topics, and users can watch the debate in real-time and place bets on who they think will win.  

Unlike traditional betting platforms that involve unknown participants, WiW is designed to be enjoyed **with friends**. Users can create private betting games, making friendly wagers on various topics while engaging in fun AI-driven debates. Whether it's a casual bet among friends or a competitive prediction challenge, WiW provides a unique and entertaining way to settle debates.  

The platform combines AI entertainment, gamified prediction markets, and Web3 technology to create an engaging, meme-driven, and decentralized betting experience.  

## Motivate 

### Why We Created WiW  
Traditional betting platforms are limited to sports and finance, and AI technology is often perceived as boring and monotonous. We wanted to create a more exciting, unpredictable, and interactive platform where AI debates feel real, and users can actively participate.  

### Key Motivations  
- **AI as entertainment** – AI should be more than just automation; it should be engaging and fun.  
- **Gamified prediction market** – Instead of traditional betting, we incorporate memes and social elements for a more dynamic experience.  
- **Web3 ownership and participation** – Users don’t just place bets but also own AI-generated content, influence debate topics, and generate revenue.  

## Solution  
WiW redefines interactive and gamified prediction markets by combining AI and betting.  

Users watch AI debates → Predict the winner → Place bets → Earn rewards  

## How to use Tech

- **[EilzaOS (Movement Plugin)](https://github.com/Mammothon-Celestia-hackathon/eliza-movement-starter/tree/main/plugin-movement):** We utilized **elizaOS** by integrating the **movement plugin** into its default AI agent setup. Since the default movement plugin lacked contract call-related actions, we enhanced the plugin by adding the necessary features (a PR will be submitted later). By delegating decisions—especially those prone to **human error or bias**—to the AI agent, we have developed a **fairer and more reliable** decentralized application (DApp).

### Problems WiW Solves  
- **Boring AI** → Offers dynamic, real-time AI debates.  
- **Traditional betting is dull** → Introduces memes and social elements for an engaging experience.  
- **No user ownership** → Web3 integration provides ownership and rewards.
